# Comparing 2 values returns a Boolean answer:
print( 0 < -1 )
print( 52 > 67 )
print( 1 > -1 )
print( 0 == 21 )
print( 11 < 22 )
# there are those comparison operators:

# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b


#
print()
#

# Using boolean in if-statements:
a = 32
b = 64

if a > b:
    print("b is greater than a") 
else: 
    print("b is not greater than a")
